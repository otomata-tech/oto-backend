"""The per-connector SNAPSHOT — what `/api/me` returns to the dashboard.

`status_for` is a PROJECTION, not a resolution: it walks the walker as a
presence probe (nothing is decrypted) and returns, for each connector, the
winning level, the levels configured beyond it, the day's quota, the missing
step declared by the connector's module and its health state.

It is structurally the mirror of `resolve_api_key` — the walker is what
guarantees it. Its two preloads (presence probe + quota map)
are built on the snapshot's SUBJECT, never on the requester: that is what
keeps a third party's admin sheet correct.

Top of the package: depends on `scope`, `cascade`, `quotas` and `rbac`, and nothing
depends on it.
