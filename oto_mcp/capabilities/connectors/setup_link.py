"""`oto_connector(op="setup_link", name=…)` — the page where a PERSON connects one
catalog connector themselves, returned to the agent that needs it.

Why: an agent that hits a missing key had two bad ways out — ask for the key in the
chat (it then sits in the model's context, the client's history and its logs), or
tell the person "go to your connectors page" and let them find the card. The front
already serves one URL per connector (`<connectors page>/<name>`, it opens that
connector's panel: key form, OAuth button or hosted login), and `http(op="setup_link")`
already handed it out for the Custom API alone. This op hands it out for EVERY catalog
connector, with what the person will be asked for, so the agent can say it in one
message.

What it does NOT do, on purpose:
- it takes no secret and puts none in the link — the key is typed in the form, which
  saves it under the person's own rights (`/api/settings/api-keys/{provider}`);
- it carries no free text chosen by the model to the page: a sentence picked by an
  agent, shown on a trusted page next to a key field, would be a phishing vector;
- it says nothing about whether a key already exists: `op=list name=…` does
  (`credential`, `next_step`), and is how the agent checks the person is done.
